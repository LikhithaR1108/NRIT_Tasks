# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Add Remote Origin
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

## Step 2: Create and Switch to Main Branch (if needed)
```bash
git branch -M main
```

## Step 3: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: If you want to create the repository first on GitHub

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name it "Day5" or whatever you prefer
5. Make it public or private as you wish
6. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"
8. Then run the commands above
